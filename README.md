## Simple New Tab

All I wanted out of a new tab page was, basically, a list of favourite bookmarks and maybe some simple widgets. I didn't want to subscribe to a service. I didn't want a bunch of crap all over the place. Mostly, I wanted bookmarks. Maybe a couple of other things. I couldn't find anything like this.

So I'm just going to make it using Bootstrap. If you want it. Have it. Me, I'm scratching my own itch.

The project is based off the [Bare template](http://startbootstrap.com/template-overviews/bare/) at [Start Bootstrap](http://startbootstrap.com/), mostly so I could get the quick set up without anything in the content area. And all I'm putting in the content area is sweet, sweet bookmarks and categories for those bookmarks. Since any modern browser can point to a page on the web for a home page/new tab, I'm going to throw this on a server and use it everywhere.

I'll have my own bookmarks in here. Feel free to clone the repo and change them to yours. Or don't. Like I said, this is mostly a tool geared towards my methods of getting stuff done -- whether that be work, blogging, indulging my image junky hobby or whatever.

The index.html file will have some sample data in it. Given that some of my bookmarks are work related, I'm suppressing the real index file. Sorry, folks.
