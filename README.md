# Simple New Tab

All I wanted out of a new tab page was, basically, a list of favourite bookmarks and maybe some simple widgets. I didn't want to subscribe to a service. I didn't want a bunch of crap all over the place. Mostly, I wanted bookmarks. Maybe a couple of other things. I couldn't find anything like this.

So I'm just going to make it using Bootstrap. If you want it. Have it. Me, I'm scratching my own itch.
